Software Design and Development Major Project

## Summary
An app that generates the best running/cycling route for the user based on a variety of factors. A route can be specified by run type, elevation, greenery and other factors such as user ratings. Coaches can use this app to track and analyse multiple participants in realtime to help runners perform at a higher level.

## Project Structure 

#### Backend:
* Our internal API written in python uses `Sanic` as an asynchronous web server.
* Clients will make requests to our API which generates a route based on given parameters using data from the Overpass API.
* Realtime tracking in the future can be made possible through the use of websockets.

#### Android Application:
Ionic framework

## Installing the server

You must have `python 3.7+` and `pipenv`. Clone the repository and run the following command.

```
pipenv install --dev
```

To run the server navigate into the server folder and run `app.py`.

```
python3 app.py
```
Make sure to have an arbitrary environment variable named `development` so that the server deploys in development mode. You can do this by adding the following line in your `.bash_profile` file. 
```export development=1```
